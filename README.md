## 1-Shakespearean Text Generation with GPT-2

  The primary goal of this project was to develop a language model based on the GPT-2 architecture to generate text in the style of **William Shakespeare**.
  The model was trained on a dataset of Shakespearean works to capture the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of the era, such as vocabulary, 
  syntax, and poetic devices like meter and rhyme.

1.1 - Text William Shakespeare 

   ```
    First Citizen:
    Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
    
    All:
    Speak, speak.
    
    First Citizen:
    You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
    
    All:
    Resolved. resolved.
    
    First Citizen:
    First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
    
    All:
    We know't, we know't.
    
    First Citizen:
    Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
    Is't a verdict?
    
    All:
    No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
    
    Second Citizen:
    One word, good citizens.
    
    First Citizen:
    We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
    What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
    would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
    wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
    but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
    afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
    inventory to particularise their abundance; our
    sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
    our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
    speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
