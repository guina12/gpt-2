## 1-Shakespearean Text Generation with GPT-2

  The primary goal of this project was to develop a language model based on the GPT-2 architecture to generate text in the style of **William Shakespeare**.
  The model was trained on a dataset of Shakespearean works to capture the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of the era, such as vocabulary, 
  syntax, and poetic devices like meter and rhyme.
